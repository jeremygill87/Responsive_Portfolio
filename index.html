                My name is Jeremy, but I generally just go by my last name: Gill.  There's just something about one-syllable names that I find alluring.
                I am based in New York City, but have deep ties to Cleveland, OH, where my fondest memories were made.
                Though I am a high school English teacher, I have always been a huge fan of technology but never really considered a career in tech until I moved to New York and met one of the 
                animators for the <emphasis>Harry Potter</emphasis> movie series.  When the man who designed and animated the knife that killed Dobby
                tells you that you should pursue a career you are passionate about, you should listen.
                So here I am.  Ready to code.

                Ah look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in a church where a wedding has been lives in her dream
                Waits at the window wearing a clock that she keeps in a jar by the door who is it for? All the lonely people where do they all come from?
                All the lonely people where do they all belong?
                Eleanor Rigby died in a church and was buried along with her name nobody came 
                Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from her grave.  No one was saved.  All the lonely people.
                Where do they all come from?  All the lonely people.  Where do they all belong?
